# REST-API

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of web service that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. RESTful APIs are designed to work with web services, and are often used to access web-based databases or other data sources. The basic principles of RESTful API design include using HTTP methods to perform actions on resources, using URLs to identify resources, and using HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call.
